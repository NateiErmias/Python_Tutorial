      "   sequence *s* are not copied; they are referenced multiple times.\n",
      "   This often haunts new Python programmers; consider:\n",

      "   to this single empty list.  Modifying any of the elements of\n",

      "4. The slice of *s* from *i* to *j* is defined as the sequence of\n",

      "Lists\n",

      "Lists are mutable sequences, typically used to store collections of\n",

      "\n",
      "class list([iterable])\n",
      "\n",
      "   Lists may be constructed in several ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "   * Using a pair of square brackets to denote the empty list: \"[]\"\n",
      "\n",
      "   * Using square brackets, separating items with commas: \"[a]\", \"[a,\n",
      "     b, c]\"\n",
      "\n",
      "   * Using a list comprehension: \"[x for x in iterable]\"\n",
      "\n",
      "   * Using the type constructor: \"list()\" or \"list(iterable)\"\n",
      "\n",
      "   The constructor builds a list whose items are the same and in the\n",
      "   same order as *iterable*’s items.  *iterable* may be either a\n",
      "   sequence, a container that supports iteration, or an iterator\n",
      "   object.  If *iterable* is already a list, a copy is made and\n",
      "   returned, similar to \"iterable[:]\". For example, \"list('abc')\"\n",
      "   returns \"['a', 'b', 'c']\" and \"list( (1, 2, 3) )\" returns \"[1, 2,\n",
      "   3]\". If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty\n",
      "   list, \"[]\".\n",

      "   Many other operations also produce lists, including the \"sorted()\"\n",
      "   built-in.\n",

      "   sort(*, key=None, reverse=False)\n",
      "\n",
      "      This method sorts the list in place, using only \"<\" comparisons\n",

      "      operations fail, the entire sort operation will fail (and the\n",
      "      list will likely be left in a partially modified state).\n",
      "\n",
      "      \"sort()\" accepts two arguments that can only be passed by\n",
      "      keyword (keyword-only arguments):\n",

      "      \"key=str.lower\"). The key corresponding to each item in the list\n",
      "      is calculated once and then used for the entire sorting process.\n",
      "      The default value of \"None\" means that list items are sorted\n",
      "      directly without calculating a separate key value.\n",
      "\n",

      "   For example, \"f(a, b, c)\" is a function call with three arguments,\n",
